<h1>The Joker is a fictional supervillain created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson who first appeared in the debut 
issue of the comic book Batman (April 25, 1940) published by DC Comics. Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and 
Robinson claimed responsibility for the Joker's design, while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although the Joker 
was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to
 endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman.In his comic book appearances, the Joker is portrayed as a criminal mastermind.
 Introduced as a psychopath with a warped, sadistic sense of humor, the character became a goofy prankster in the late 1950s in
 response to regulation by the Comics Code Authority, before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s. As Batman's 
 nemesis, the Joker has been part of the superhero's defining stories, including the murder of Jason Todd—the second Robin and 
 Batman's ward—and the paralysis of one of Batman's allies, Barbara Gordon. The Joker has had various possible origin stories 
 during his decades of appearances. The most common story involves him falling into a tank of chemical waste which bleaches his 
 skin white, turns his hair green, and his lips bright red; the resulting disfigurement drives him insane. The antithesis of Batman 
 in personality and appearance, the Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary.The Joker possesses no superhuman abilities,
 instead using his expertise in chemical engineering to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions, and thematic weaponry, including 
 razor-tipped playing cards, deadly joy buzzers, and acid-spraying lapel flowers. The Joker sometimes works with other Gotham City
 supervillains such as the Penguin and Two-Face, and groups like the Injustice Gang and Injustice League, but these relationships 
 often collapse due to the Joker's desire for unbridled chaos. The 1990s introduced a romantic interest for the Joker in his former
 psychiatrist, Harley Quinn, who becomes his villainous sidekick. Although his primary obsession is Batman, the Joker has also fought
 other heroes including Superman and Wonder Woman.One of the most iconic characters in popular culture,[3][4] the Joker has been 
 listed among the greatest comic book villains and fictional characters ever created.[5][6] The character's popularity has seen him
 appear on a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectable items, inspire real-world structures (such as theme park 
 attractions), and be referenced in a number of media. The Joker has been adapted to serve as Batman's adversary in live-action,
 animated, and video game incarnations, including the 1960s Batman television series (played by Cesar Romero) and in film by Jack Nicholson 
 in Batman (1989), Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight (2008), and Jared Leto in Suicide Squad (2016). Mark Hamill, Troy Baker, and others have
 provided the character's voice.
